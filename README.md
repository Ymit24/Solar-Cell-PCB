# Solar Cell PCB
For my ELEN433 - Optoelectronics class I'm creating a simple PCB to house a solar cell and provide easy breakout terminals and common functionality. 
This will be used in a lab setting for students to easily interface with the solar cell.
This is also a project for earning honors credit for this course.

# Rendering
TODO: Add rendered PCB once complete.

# Report
Along with the completed PCB, this project involves writing a short report which describes the design process, manufacturing and ordering process, assembly process, and a how-to-use guide for future reference.
